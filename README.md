Better Musician is a web app for musicians to facilitate storing/searching/cataloguing their musical repertoire.

It features a dynamic field builder that allows users to build their own templates, only displaying relevant information to them.

The app is currently in the beta stage.

Based on the [templates-client](https://github.com/njhoffman/templates-client) core framework. Will be eventually included as a submodule with an eject script to deploy core files.
